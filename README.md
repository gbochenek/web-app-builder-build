# web-app-builder-build
Example of using the Dojo Build with an ArcGIS Web App Builder Application.

There is now an npm module that will do this for you: https://github.com/gbochenek/esri-wab-build

Adapted from build scripts provided by @qlqllu at https://geonet.esri.com/docs/DOC-3795

# Sample Build Run
1. Ensure npm, Node.js, and Java are installed.
2. Open a command prompt to the root directory.
